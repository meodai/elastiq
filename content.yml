      David is one of the rare people who know how to write scalable and readable CSS. He strives for perfection and his systematic approach makes it easy to pick up where he left. David taught me that there is more to CSS than spaghetti and pixels.

      David is an expert when it comes to Frontend & Interaction. Regardless of the type of animation, he’s always making sure that the performance, the smoothness and usability are present to provide the best possible user experience. I’ve met him as an intern. He taught me the creative coding basics and he made sure that I understood what I was crafting. Learning from him has been a real pleasure.

      David is the kind of person who's creativity comes alive through order. His art is a mixture of math and language and he'll manage to transform all kinds of messes into organized beauty. No matter if it's about untangling non-maintainable code or coming up with crucial language in a design system or coding visuals to transform hard-to-grasp concepts into understandable images. As an excellent communicator he not only manages to transform his ideas into scalable code, but also eloquently let's people into his head so they can follow along. He is a talented teacher and an uplifting peer that easily slots into a team, able to bridge a gap between frontend and design.
