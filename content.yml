      David is one of the rare people who know how to write scalable and readable CSS. He strives for perfection and his systematic approach makes it easy to pick up where he left. David taught me that there is more to CSS than spaghetti and pixels.

      David is an expert when it comes to Frontend & Interaction. Regardless of the type of animation, he’s always making sure that the performance, the smoothness and usability are present to provide the best possible user experience. I’ve met him as an intern. He taught me the creative coding basics and he made sure that I understood what I was crafting. Learning from him has been a real pleasure.
